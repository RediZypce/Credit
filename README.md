# Fraud Detection Project

## Overview
This project is aimed at developing a fraud detection system using machine learning techniques. The objective is to build a model that can identify fraudulent transactions within a given dataset. The dataset used for this project is named [transactions.csv.](transactions.csv). To get started click ["Here"](Credit_Card_Fraud.ipynb)

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key components:

* Data Loading and Exploration: 
The dataset, "transactions.csv," is loaded and explored to understand its structure and content. Initial data analysis is performed to gain insights into the dataset.

* Feature Engineering: 
New features, such as 'isPayment,' 'isMovement,' and 'accountDiff,' are created to enhance the dataset's information. These features are designed to capture patterns related to payment types and movement types.

* Data Splitting and Normalization:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation. Feature scaling is applied using the StandardScaler to ensure that the model can work effectively with the data.

* Model Training: 
A logistic regression model is trained using the training data. The model aims to predict fraudulent transactions based on the engineered features.

* Model Evaluation: 
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. This evaluation provides insights into how well the model can identify fraudulent transactions.

* Visualizations: 
A series of insightful visualizations are generated to better understand the data, feature importance, and model performance. These visualizations include histograms, bar plots, correlation heatmaps, and more.

## Additional Information
Dataset Name: "transactions.csv"
